# Slackbot-GPT

Slackbot-GPT is a Slack app that allows you to interact with the GPT models of OpenAI using natural language. You can ask questions, generate text, and explore the capabilities of various GPT models in a conversational way.

This project uses the (OpenAI API)[https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction] and the (Slack API)[https://api.slack.com/] to create a bot user that can communicate with the GPT models and send the responses back to Slack. You can customize the bot userâ€™s name, icon, and default model.

To use this app, you need to have an OpenAI account with access to the GPT models and a Slack workspace where you can install the app. You also need to set up some environment variables and install some dependencies. For more details, please see the Installation and Usage sections below.
